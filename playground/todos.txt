- review design of particle manager/collision detector / geometry vs particles / etc. Too much vector passing and copying. Review polymorfism / std::vector<unique_ptr> usage.

- add 'override' to overridden virtual methods (forces compiler to check everything is ok)

- review RAII of resources

- review 5 of 5 principle (move semantics)

- Review collision action design: use lambdas instead of template pattern for collision response actions. Review design of BulletParticle used for playing sounds on balls bouncing.

- Review collision detection / response: there is no way to configure restitution factor - should be based on the two objects colliding and/or configurable.

- improve box rendering (normals)

- rename events to onEvent (resize -> onResize) since this collides with imperative methods meaning there's no good method name to trigger window resize).

Add menu for selecting demo.

TerrainDemo: 
	- Add class to compose several terrain patches and make calculations to determine which patch. 
	- mod infinite terrain? render those inside camera frustrum
	- Add some class to generate bounding geometry from this.
	- Some other tree model
	- Add grass / ferns with transparency
	- use own particle class or review design (lambdas maybe?)

Battle city:
Battle road:
tanques vs naves
defend the tower
scenery (with train or racing cars - lightning mcqueen and cruz, wind/rain, vegetation and animals, water, day/night transition, sun and moon, etc.)


ColDetDemo:
 - use particleManager and geometry renderer to detect/resolve collisions and draw stuff onscreen.
